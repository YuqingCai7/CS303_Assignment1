## Main Menu

When the user initializes the program, they will be greeted by the main menu listed on the right. The user may use commands such as ‘C’, ‘M’, ‘A’, ‘E’, or ‘Q’ to achieve desirable outcome.

## Check

Users may enter ‘C’ to check if a specific number exists and return its index. For example, if the user wishes to check the integer “77”, then the program will return the index of the integer, which is 76.

If the number does not exist in the list, the system will notify the user that the integer is not found.

## Modify

Users may enter ‘M’ to replace the original value at the desirable index with a new value. For example, if the user wishes to replace the number 6 with 17, then they simply need to use ‘M’ and enter the index (5) with the new value in the next line, and system will return both original and new values.

If the index entered by the user is out of bounds, the system will provide according to notification to the user.

Similarly, if the user enters anything other than a integer for the new value, such as a string, the system will also notify the user about the invalid input.

However, if the user attempted to add anything other than an integer, the system will remind the user to enter an integer instead.
